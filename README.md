## ⚙️ Tech Stack

- 🤩 NextJS - The awesome react framework (frontend)
- ✍️ Appwrite - Database, auth, as BaaS, etc.
- 💅 Sass - The best flavor of CSS
- 🌞 Next-themes - For dark/light mode

## 🔥 How to setup

#### ✨ Frontend - NextJS

It's pretty straight-forward. Just lookup the installation for any NextJS appliction. `npm install` stuff, rename the `.env.example` to `.env`, change the values, test the app with `npm run dev`.

#### 🍑 Appwrite

I don't have the config files anymore, I think. I didn't back them up either, so you have to figure out the database schema yourself, sorry :(

## 🙋‍♀️ FAQs

### 🤔 But... How much of the app is left?

I'd say around 30% of it is left, but I'm already so done with this! (I'll be very careful to only work on projects that add value in the future, not just look good)

### 👩‍🔧 Why did you create this in the first place

Actually, this was supposed to be a [hackathon](https://dev.to/devteam/announcing-the-appwrite-hackathon-on-dev-1oc0) project. I wanted to have an app where I could drop my screenshots, and make them look beautiful by adding a gradient border (just like the screenshots above). But this wasn't gonna cut it for the hackathon. So I decided to add twitter-like functionality to make it more engaging, and utilize the full power of Appwrite. I knew I would never be able to retain any users, but I still started making it, thinking about the skills I'd gain. After a point, it got pretty repetetive. 

At the same time, I discovered [pika.style](https://pika.style), which did the same exact thing I wanted to do with the screenshot thing. Alongside, I got kind-of burned out, so I wasn't able to finish this on time, and also, the time I spent on this negatively affected my high-school exam scores (since I didn't have a lot of time anyway), so I ended up dropping the idea, and don't regret it a lot. :(

### 😑 When would you start working on this again?

Honestly, I don't think it's the best investment of my time. The main goal was to learn Appwrite and use it in pet projects, but I quickly realized that Appwrite wasn't what I thought, and that put limitations on the use-cases.

Anyway, I'd still like to finish this project if I get the time, but very in-probable. If I have the assurity that the work would be noticed, I would surely work on it, but that's unlikely (unless this repo gets a lot of stars, of-course ;)
